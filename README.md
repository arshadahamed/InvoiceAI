**InvoiceAI**
**---Automatic Invoice Data Extrator----**

This project, in a general sense, therefore, involves creating an automated invoice 
processing system and deploying it to M.K.C Trading Center by using Optical 
Character Recognition technologies. This system is introduced to automate manual 
processes that are used in handling a diverse array of supplier invoices; therefore, 
more streamlined financial operations are achieved. 
The system will obtain printed invoices from various suppliers and convert them into a 
digital format using OCR technology. And the system will pull out important information 
from the invoices, such as supplier details, invoice number, date, item descriptions, 
quantities, prices, and totals. And User can store extracted data into database by 
migrating the data.

Technologies Used
-.Net Framework C#
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology with MINDEE API
- SQL Server for database management
